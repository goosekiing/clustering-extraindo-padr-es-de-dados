# Clustering: Extracting Patterns from Data

This repository contains a project focused on using clustering techniques to extract patterns from data. The dataset includes consumption data of unidentified customers from a bank. The KMeans method is used to separate these customers into clusters based on their usage patterns of the bank's services. Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz metrics are applied to evaluate the cluster separation. Finally, an analysis of the characteristics of each cluster is conducted to identify the customer patterns represented by each cluster.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore methods for clustering customers based on their banking service usage patterns and to analyze the characteristics of each cluster.

## Course Details
This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning course on Alura. For more information about the course, visit [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-machine-learning-v64177).
